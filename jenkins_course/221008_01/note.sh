# Jenkins initial setup is required. An admin user has been created and a password generated.
# Please use the following password to proceed to installation:

# This may also be found at: /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

# We need to use this information
# In the browser we go to: localhost:8080
# there we need to use the token to confirm that we are the owners of the

# I had a problem with not having php and composer inside the container

# I need to install PHP inside the Jenkis server
# and then install Composer

# https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-latest-php-on-debian/

# Step 1: Update system 
apt update && apt upgrade -y && reboot

# Step 2: Add SURY PHP PPA repository
apt -y install lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates 
wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/php.gpg https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg
echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list

# Step 3: Install PHP 7.4 on Debian 10 / Debian 9
apt update
apt install php7.4 -y

# How to install Composer?
# https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-composer
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"

# I have a problem with the container the default user is not root
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/72042637/15875971
docker exec -u 0 -it jenkins /bin/bash
# this works!
# we just need to include -u 0 

# try to run the job again

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer
