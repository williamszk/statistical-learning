I think that paragraphs <p> are block elements.
That is they occupy the whole line.

We have block elements and inline elements.
Inline elements occupy just the space they need in the line.

And all the other options?
What does

It's for designing user interfaces.

Mockup is a more elaborate plan for the web design.

Prototype is an implemented website without the backend but with the animation.
