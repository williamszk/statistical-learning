# system state, when we can't observe it directly

# In a rocket engine we can't place a sensor 
# too close to the heat source because the sensor 
# would burn
# so we place the sensor in a cooler place
# but in this situation we can't measure
# directly the temperature of the turbine
# this is a situation where kalman filters
# can help us measure the true temperature of 
# the engine
# 
# temperature of the interior of turbine
# T_in 
# temperature of exterior of turbine
# T_ext

# car navigation system
# onboard sensors
# IMU = intertial measurement unit
# it measures acceleration and angular velocity of the car

# if the car is inside a tunnel we cant measure it's position
# so we dont know where the car is
# we cant measure its position through GPS
# 
# but still we can use IMU
# we can use odometer readings
# odometers measures how much the wheel has turned
# these forms of measurement are prone to drift
# GPS location has less frequent updates
# and it is noisy
#

# a Kalman filter can be used 
# to use the measurements of three sensors types
# to find the exact position of the car
# guidance and naviation systems
# signal processing

# probabilistic 
# estimate the state of a dynamic system
# dynamic systems involve time
# usually time series

# prediction step
# correction step
