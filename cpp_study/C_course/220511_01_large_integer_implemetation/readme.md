In this project we implement large integer (128 bits) arithmetic and bit operations.

The objective here is for learning of C and lower level programming skills.

The large integer of 128 bits is built using an array of 4 elements, where each element
is 32 bits.

Some objectives with this project:

- Use snake case for variables and function names.
- Use 32bit integers as the smallest word, and then use casting for 64 bit.
- The right-most element of the array represent the smaller numbers in the 128 bit representation.


Build methods:

- increment_u128
- not_operator_u128
- twos_complement_u128
- decrement_u128
- addition
- subtraction
- smaller
- bigger
- equal
- notequal
- leftShift
- rightShift
- multiplication
- division
- leftRotate
- rightRotate
