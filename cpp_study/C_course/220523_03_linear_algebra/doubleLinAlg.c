// can we build a function that could accept differt input types
// we want to build a function that can accept double, float, int, uint32 etc
// but with the same name
// maybe this would be method overloading in Java
// or generics?

// why operations with double are more expensive compared to operations with 
// integers? How can we make use of this fact
// so that we can build faster algorithm?
