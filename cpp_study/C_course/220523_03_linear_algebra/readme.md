Some ideas for implementing linear algebra operations.

Use intenger numbers to make linear algebra operations.

- Add
- Vector subtraction: what is the graphical intuition behind subtraction?
- Vector Multiplication by scalar, this is called scalling.


Work with two dimensional vectors.
Next build operations for 3 dimensional vectors
and then we can generalize them later.

The idea in the end is to use those libraries for linear algebra to build algorithms on top.

There is a graphical intuition behind vector sum.

We can take two vectors and order tails one after the other and the resulting vector that is starts at the origin and ends at the end of the joining of the two vectors
is the sum of the two vectors.

Maybe using JavaScript we could build some graphical interface that can sum two vectors and show a graph in the page.
