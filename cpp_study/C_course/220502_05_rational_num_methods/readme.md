Build methods:

- increment
- decrement
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- smaller
- bigger
- equal
- notequal

For the struct Rational number.

Next we should try to implement those functions for large integers, using arrays of unsigned long. 
And then treat them as signed integers. We'll need to use 2's complement and other concepts for this to work.
Implement bit shift, and bit rotation also.
