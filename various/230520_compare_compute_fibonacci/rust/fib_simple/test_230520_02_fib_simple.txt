Benchmark 1: ./target/release/fib_simple
  Time (mean ± σ):       0.5 ms ±   2.0 ms    [User: 0.6 ms, System: 0.3 ms]
  Range (min … max):     0.0 ms …  38.8 ms    1000 runs
 
  Warning: Command took less than 5 ms to complete. Results might be inaccurate.
  Warning: The first benchmarking run for this command was significantly slower than the rest (1.8 ms). This could be caused by (filesystem) caches that were not filled until after the first run. You should consider using the '--warmup' option to fill those caches before the actual benchmark. Alternatively, use the '--prepare' option to clear the caches before each timing run.

  Warning: Command took less than 5 ms to complete. Results might be inaccurate.
  Warning: The first benchmarking run for this command was significantly slower than the rest (1.9 ms). This could be caused by (filesystem) caches that were not filled until after the first run. You should consider using the '--warmup' option to fill those caches before the actual benchmark. Alternatively, use the '--prepare' option to clear the caches before each timing run.

# with 10_000 for warmup
hyperfine "./target/release/fib_simple" --warmup 10000 -r 1000
Benchmark 1: ./target/release/fib_simple
  Time (mean ± σ):       0.1 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 0.5 ms, System: 0.3 ms]

  Warning: Command took less than 5 ms to complete. Results might be inaccurate.
  Warning: Statistical outliers were detected. Consider re-running this benchmark on a quiet PC without any interferences from other programs. It might help to use the '--warmup' or '--prepare' options.
