Benchmark 1: cargo run
  Time (mean ± σ):      9.224 s ±  0.365 s    [User: 9.073 s, System: 0.026 s]
  Range (min … max):    8.736 s …  9.738 s    10 runs

Benchmark 1: ./target/release/fib_simple
  Time (mean ± σ):       0.2 ms ±   1.2 ms    [User: 0.6 ms, System: 0.3 ms]
  Range (min … max):     0.0 ms …  27.2 ms    1081 runs
 
  Warning: Command took less than 5 ms to complete. Results might be inaccurate.
  Warning: Statistical outliers were detected. Consider re-running this benchmark on a quiet PC without any interferences from other programs. It might help to use the '--warmup' or '--prepare' options.

# what happens if we don't use warmup?
# the result is much worse, there is some optimization that happens in execution
hyperfine "./target/release/fib_simple"
Benchmark 1: ./target/release/fib_simple
  Time (mean ± σ):       0.9 ms ±   1.5 ms    [User: 0.7 ms, System: 0.4 ms]
  Range (min … max):     0.0 ms …   9.2 ms    445 runs
 
  Warning: Command took less than 5 ms to complete. Results might be inaccurate.
  Warning: The first benchmarking run for this command was significantly slower than the rest (4.9 ms). This could be caused by (filesystem) caches that were not filled until after the first run. You should consider using the '--warmup' option to fill those caches before the actual benchmark. Alternatively, use the '--prepare' option to clear the caches before each timing run.

# what happens with a smaller warmup?
# the results get a little better, the warmup of 1000, gives 0.2ms
hyperfine "./target/release/fib_simple" --warmup 100
Benchmark 1: ./target/release/fib_simple
  Time (mean ± σ):       0.7 ms ±   2.0 ms    [User: 0.7 ms, System: 0.3 ms]
  Range (min … max):     0.0 ms …  22.5 ms    434 runs
