fib simple is running idx = 40
expected answer = 165580141

python3 main.py
165580141; elapsed_time: 2.3856731410014618s
165580141; elapsed_time: 2.4358989809989s

When comparing with the results here we need to run 1_000_000 times the same function
of fibonacci;

Next:
- Compare the fib that uses recursion.
- Run the Rust fib_simple 1 million times, and compare it with this result.
