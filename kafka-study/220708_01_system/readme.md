Some ideas for projects:

- Build a simple system where we have 1 producer and 1 consumer.
- Try to make this work with just terminal based producer and consumer.
- Both are written in Python.
- First build locally.
- Then build them in containers.
- Then in one of them use Go.
- Then in another use C.
- In all of them use confluent's client libraries. 


Maybe starting using containers is going to be easier
