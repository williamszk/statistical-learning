The notes in the project are based on:

Some ideas for to do and next steps:

- Create a program that will feed be a artificial data source, this will generate data to the topic.

- Separate the `producer_consumer_parse_recipes.py` into two modules, where we have a module for consumer and another for
producer.

- Build the same application using containers.
We should take a look at the other Kafka tutorial that uses containers
to base our implementation.
