;; The easy one:
;; Write a function that takes two base-26 numbers in which digits are represented by 
;; letters with A=0, B=1, … Z=25 and returns their product using the same notation. As an example, CSGHJ × CBA = FNEUZJA.
;; Your task is to write the base-26 multiplication function.
;; Try to be very efficient in your code!


;; CSGHJ * CBA = FNEUZJA

;; what is the difference between Long and int and Integer in Java?
;; clojure uses Java types in many situations
;; in java there is the difference between primitive types and objects
;; what is the difference?

;; An int is a 32-bit integer; a long is a 64-bit integer. 
;; Which one to use depends on how large the numbers are that you expect to work with.

;; int and long are primitive types, while Integer and Long are objects. 
;; Primitive types are more efficient, but sometimes you need to use objects; 
;; for example, Java's collection classes can only work with objects, so if 
;; you need a list of integers you have to make it a List<Integer>, for example 
;; (you can't use int in a List directly).
