The `resources` directory contains code that acts as the middleware between
the external world and the internal world of the programming language.

In the case of REST APIs the focus is on the resource management aspect of the communication between an external client and the Python native data structures.

REST stands for Resource State Transfer.

Usually we are dealing with the state and resource management that lives inside a database.

The programming languange (Python, Java, etc) stands in the middle of this communication.
It serves as a way to specify what are the ways in which we can manage the resources that live inside the database.
