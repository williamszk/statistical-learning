Thie section is section 5

The convention for this project is to run the application from the root:
`220703_01_sqlite`
directory.

So we use code from section 4 to start this section

https://github.com/tecladocode/rest-apis-flask-python/tree/master/section4

Some ideas to expand this application:
- Include hashing in password
- Containarized the application
