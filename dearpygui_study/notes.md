# Some ideas for projects

- Build a graphical interface to comsume data from a database

- We can start with a mysql database

- For dearpygui application we can set it on the host OS

- For the mysql we can host it on a container

- But I'll need to know how to access the mysql server inside the container from the outside

- The frist feature of the GUI is to be able to access and see some data from the database

- And this application can access any database anywhere, given that it is a SQL database. (is that it?)
