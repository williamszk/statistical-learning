# Download financial data
# find stocks data and apply time series forecasting models on it


# we go some data from:
# https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/index/spx/historical

# the problem with this data is that it is too big to be sent to github all at once
# we could try to send this data to somewhere else
# I can try to save this data into my personal aws s3

# we should try to partition the data first and then zip it in a 
# single directory and then send it to my personal aws s3
# the partitioning part is just for practice
# we can do the reading and partitioning using Go just for practice
